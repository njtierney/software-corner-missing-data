 abstract={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite the large body of research on missing value distributions and imputation, there is comparatively little literature with a focus on how to make it easy to handle, explore, and impute missing values in data. This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with the goal of integrating missing value handling as a key part of data analysis workflows. We define a new data structure, and a suite of new operations. Together, these provide a connected framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods are available in the R package naniar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

Each record contains date, treatment, transect, trap station, species, specimen number, recapture status, specimen disposition, external body measurements (where applicable), reproductive information, and miscellaneous associated comments. These sampling records are based on nightly captures during one 4-night trapping period in summer (June through August) for each of 16 permanent transects established on eight fire treatments (two transects per treatment). These treatments include two seasonal burn watersheds (SpB, SuB), two reversal burn watersheds (R1A, R20A), one annual burn watershed (1D), two 4-year burn watersheds (4B, 4F, and one 20-year burn watershed (20B). None of these treatments implement bison grazing.},
